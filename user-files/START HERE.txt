                           PALPABLE OS - QUICK START
================================================================================

Welcome! You're holding the easiest way to set up your Palpable device.

WHAT TO DO:

1. EDIT SETTINGS (optional)
   Open "settings.txt" in this folder and fill in your WiFi details.
   If you skip this, your Pi will create a WiFi hotspot for setup.

2. COPY FILES TO SD CARD
   Copy the entire "boot" folder contents to an SD card formatted as FAT32.
   On Mac: Use Disk Utility > Erase > Format: MS-DOS (FAT)
   On Windows: Right-click drive > Format > FAT32

3. INSERT & POWER ON
   Put the SD card in your Raspberry Pi and plug in power.
   Wait ~60 seconds for first boot.

4. CONNECT
   - If you configured WiFi: Your Pi should appear in the Palpable app
   - If no WiFi: Connect to "Palpable-XXXX" WiFi network
     Then open http://palpable.local or http://192.168.4.1

THAT'S IT!
